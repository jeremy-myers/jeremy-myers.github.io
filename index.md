**Jeremy Myers**

I research algorithms and software at Sandia National Labs.

I'm interested in:
- matrix and tensor decompositions
- distributed and parallel computing

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from The College of William and Mary in 2024.

I develop [skema](https://github.com/jeremy-myers/skema) for matrix sketching.

Some projects I'm involved with:
- [pyttb](https://github.com/sandialabs/pyttb)
- [genten](https://github.com/sandialabs/GenTen)
- [sparten](https://github.com/sandialabs/sparten)
