**Jeremy Myers**

I am a research software engineer based in Berlin, Germany.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from The College of William and Mary in
Virginia (US) in 2024 where I did my dissertation on matrix and tensor
decompositions. Before that, I received my B.S. and M.S. in Applied Math from
Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA (US).

During my Ph.D., I interned at Sandia National Laboratories and had the chance
to join the staff after graduation. In August 2025, I left Sandia to move to
Germany with my wife and our dog.

Some topics I'm interested in:
- high performance computing
- numerical linear algebra
- parallel programming
- machine learning

I like to program in modern C++ and Python. Recently, I've been enjoying
learning Rust.

Some projects I am (or have been) involved with:
- [skema](https://github.com/jeremy-myers/skema)
- [pyttb](https://github.com/sandialabs/pyttb)
