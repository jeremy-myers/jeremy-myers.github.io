**Jeremy Myers**

I research algorithms and software at Sandia National Labs.

I'm interested in:
- matrix and tensor decompositions
- distributed and parallel computing

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from The College of William and Mary in 2024.

I live in the Portland, OR area with my wife and our dog.
