I am a 5th year Ph.D Candidate under the supervision of Dr. Andreas
Stathopoulos in the Computer Science Department at the College of William and
Mary.  Since 2019, I have also conducted doctoral research under the
supervision of Dr. Daniel Dunlavy at Sandia National Laboratories in
Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA.  My work lies at the intersection
of numerical linear algebra, machine learning, data science, and high
performance computing. Specifically, my research focuses on
streaming/sketching spectral decompositions and tensor decompositions.
Most recently, my research has appeared in IEEE HPEC20 \& IEEE HPEC21.
I received a B.S. and a M.S. in Mathematical Sciences from Virginia
Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA, in 2014 and 2017,
respectively, and a B.A. in International Affairs from James Madison
University in Harrisonburg, VA, in 2009.

I enjoy trail running, gravel cycling, loud music, German and Russian
languages, and South American food. I live in the Portland, OR area
with my wife and our two dogs.
