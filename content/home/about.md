I am a 6th year Ph.D Candidate under
the supervision of Dr. Andreas Stathopoulos in the Computer Science Department
at the College of William and Mary.  Since 2019, I have also conducted doctoral
research under the supervision of Dr. Daniel Dunlavy at Sandia National
Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA.  My work lies at the
intersection of numerical linear algebra, machine learning, data science, and
high performance computing. Specifically, my research focuses on
streaming/sketching spectral decompositions and tensor decompositions.  Most
recently, my research has appeared in IEEE HPEC20 \& IEEE HPEC21.  I received a
B.S. and a M.S. in Mathematical Sciences from Virginia Commonwealth University
in Richmond, VA, in 2014 and 2017, respectively, and a B.A. in International
Affairs from James Madison University in Harrisonburg, VA, in 2009.

I enjoy trail running, gravel cycling, loud music, German and Russian
languages, and South American food. I live in the Portland, OR area
with my wife and our two dogs..

**Specialties:** Tensors, mentorship, matrix sketching
