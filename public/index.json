In this work, we consider several algorithms for computing a low-rank PTF of tensors with sparse count data values via maximum likelihood estimation. Such an approach reduces to solving a nonlinear, non-convex optimization problem, which can leverage considerable parallel computation due to the structure of the problem. However, since the maximum likelihood estimator corresponds to the global minimizer of this optimization problem, it is important to consider how effective methods are at both leveraging this inherent parallelism as well as computing a good approximation to the global minimizer. In this work we present comparisons of multiple methods for PTF that illustrate the tradeoffs in computational efficiency and accurately computing the maximum likelihood estimator. We present results using synthetic and real-world data tensors to demonstrate some of the challenges when choosing a method for a given tensor.","tags":[],"title":"Using Computation Effectively for Scalable Poisson Tensor Factorization: Comparing Methods Beyond Computational Efficiency","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeremy M.

One problem of particular interest is fitting a  low-rank Canonical Polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition model when the tensor has sparse structure and the tensor elements are nonnegative count data. SparTen is a high-performance C++ library which computes a low-rank decomposition using different solvers: a first-order quasi-Newton or a second-order damped Newton method, along with the appropriate choice of runtime parameters. Since default parameters in SparTen are tuned to experimental results in prior published work on a single real-world dataset conducted using MATLAB implementations of these methods, it remains unclear if the parameter defaults in SparTen are appropriate for general tensor data. Furthermore, it is unknown how sensitive algorithm convergence is to changes in the input parameter values. This report addresses these unresolved issues with large-scale experimentation on three benchmark tensor data sets. Experiments were conducted on several different CPU architectures and replicated with many initial states to establish generalized profiles of algorithm convergence behavior.","tags":[],"title":"Parameter Sensitivity Analysis of the SparTen High Performance Sparse Tensor Decomposition Software","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Keita Teranishi","Daniel M.

One of the variants using projected damped Newton optimization for row subproblems (PDNR) offers quadratic convergence and is amenable to parallelization.  Despite its potential effectiveness, PDNR performance on modern high performance computing (HPC) systems is not well understood.  To remedy this, we have developed a parallel implementation of PDNR using Kokkos, a performance portable parallel programming framework supporting efficient runtime of a single code base on  multiple HPC systems. We demonstrate that the performance of parallel PDNR can be poor if load imbalance associated with the irregular distribution of nonzero entries in the tensor data is not addressed. Preliminary results using tensors from the FROSTT data set indicate that using multiple kernels to address this imbalance  when solving the PDNR row subproblems in parallel can improve performance, with up to 80% speedup on CPUs and 10-fold speedup on NVIDIA GPUs.","tags":["\"conference\"","\"refereed\""],"title":"SparTen: Leveraging Kokkos for On-node Parallelism in a Second-Order Method for Fitting Canonical Polyadic Tensor Models to Poisson Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Keita Teranishi","D.
